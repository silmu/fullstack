Code on the server responsible for the POST request is run:

    app.post('/new_note', (req, res) => {
    notes.push({
        content: req.body.note,
        date: new Date(),
    })

Data is sent as the body of the POST-request.
The server creates a new note object, and adds 
it to an array called notes.

    content: req.body.note, //actual content of the note
    date: new Date(), //date and time
    })
